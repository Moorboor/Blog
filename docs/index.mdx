# Electromagnetism

The energy of a battery is often given in volts \(V\) and amperes \(A\). 
Normally, the total energy is calculated by

\[
E = F \cdot d \quad (E \text{ in Joules, where } F \text{ is in Newtons and } d \text{ in meters})
\]

where the energy \(E\) has the units of Joules \(J = \mathrm{kg} \cdot \mathrm{m}^2 \cdot \mathrm{s}^{-2}\). Analogous to the energy formula, volt \(V\) is defined as

\[
V = \frac{E}{Q},
\]

where \(Q\) is the electric charge in coulombs \(\mathrm{C}\). Coulomb is defined as

\[
1\,\mathrm{C} = \frac{1}{1.602176634 \cdot 10^{-19}} e,
\]

where it is defined in terms of the elementary charge \(e\). It is the electrical charge that flows through a cross-section of a conductor within a second. 

\[
Q = 1A \cdot 1s = \frac{1}{1.602176634 \cdot 10^{-19} \cdot \mathrm{s}} e \cdot \mathrm{s},
\]

where \(A\) is ampere.

Eventually, volts \(V\) can be interpreted as energy \(E\) in proportions of the strength of electrical flow \(Q\).
