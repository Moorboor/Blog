# Here will my journey begin

Hello the first thing I want to try is to showcase some youtube links of my video to learn a little bit **html** and **markdown**
```bash
npm install myawesomelib
```
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=nEWUc89PD2Y
" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/nEWUc89PD2Y/0.jpg" 
alt="My new video" width="720" height="480" border="10" /></a>


Or in pure markdown:
[![I call it other version](http://img.youtube.com/vi/nEWUc89PD2Y/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEWUc89PD2Y)

```bash
s = this is now code right
print s
```

> This is my blockquote section. I want to see
> how this is working?

> Here now should be another blockquote right?


Markdown | Less | Pretty
--- | --- | ---
*Still* | `renders` | **nicely**
1 | 2 | 3
