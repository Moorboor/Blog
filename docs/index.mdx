# Electromagnetism


The energy of a battery is often given in volts $V$ and ampere $A$. 
Normally, the total energy is calculated by

$E=F\cdot \mathrm{m}=m\cdot a\cdot\mathrm{m}$,

where the energy $E$ has the units of Joules $J=\mathrm{kg}\cdot \mathrm{m}^2\mathrm{s}^{-2}$ and the force $F$ has the units of Newtons $N$. Analogous to the energy formula, volt $V$ is defined as

$\displaystyle V = \frac{E}{Q}$, 

where $Q$ is the electric charge in coulomb $\mathrm{C}$. Coulomb is defined as

$\displaystyle 1\,\mathrm{C}=\frac{1}{1.602176634\cdot 10^{-19}}e$,

where it is defined in terms of the elementary charge $e$.
It is the electrical charge that flows through a cross section of a conductor within a second. 

$Q= 1A\cdot 1\mathrm{s}= \frac{1}{1.602176634\cdot 10^{-19}\cdot\mathrm{s}} e\cdot \mathrm{s}$, 

where $A$ is ampere.


Eventually, volts $V$ can be interpreted as energy $E$ in proportions of the strength of electrical flow $Q$.
